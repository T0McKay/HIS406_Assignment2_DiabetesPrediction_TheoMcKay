# HIS406_Assignment2_DiabetesPrediction_TheoMcKay

This repository has been used to track the creation of a prototype AI model that can predict diabetes risk. This has been done as part of my AI+ML module, assignment 2.

I have used Prima Indians Diabetes Dataset to do this.

In the jupyter notebook, I have cleaned and proprocessed the dataset, train/test split the data 80/20, and explored the different accuracies and suitabilities of 4 supervised ML models:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree (using gini index)
* Decision Tree (using entropy index)
* K-Nearest Neighbours

After evaluating each model, I found Logistic Regression was most suitable for this scenario.
